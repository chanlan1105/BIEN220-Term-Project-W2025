  abstract = "Despite all the efforts made in tissue engineering for tendon
              repair, the management of tendon injuries still poses a
              challenge, as current treatments are unable to restore the
              function of tendons following injuries. Hydrogels, due to their
              exceptional biocompatibility and plasticity, have been
              extensively applied and regarded as promising candidate
              biomaterials in tissue regeneration. Varieties of approaches have
              designed functionally-adapted hydrogels and combined hydrogels
              with other factors (e.g., bioactive molecules or drugs) or
              materials for the enhancement of tendon repair. This review first
              summarized the current state of knowledge on the mechanisms
              underlying the process of tendon healing. Afterward, we discussed
              novel strategies in fabricating hydrogels to overcome the issues
              frequently encountered during the applications in tendon repair,
              including poor mechanical properties and undesirable degradation.
              In addition, we comprehensively summarized the rational design of
              hydrogels for promoting stem-cell-based tendon tissue engineering
              via altering biophysical and biochemical factors. Finally, the
              role of macrophages in tendon repair and how they respond to
              immunomodulatory hydrogels were highlighted.",

With rapid advances in tissue engineering, a variety of strategies including advanced biomaterials, bioactive growth factors and multiple stem cell lineages have been developed to facilitate the healing of this tissue interface. Given the important role of structure-function relationship, the review begins with a brief description of enthesis structure and composition. Next, the biomimetic biomaterials including decellularized extracellular matrix scaffolds and synthetic-/natural-origin scaffolds are critically examined. Then, the key roles of the combination, concentration and location of various growth factors in biomimetic application are emphasized. After that, the various stem cell sources and culture systems are described. At last, we discuss unmet needs and existing challenges in the ideal strategies for tendon/ligament-to-bone regeneration and highlight emerging strategies in the field.}
