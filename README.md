## Git and GitHub
- Ideally `git commit` and `git push` at the end of each work session, even if work is incomplete. This way we all have the latest work (even if it's still in progress)

## References
- Create your own BibLaTeX `.bib` file so we don't overwrite each other's references.

## Figures
- Should be stored in the `Figures/` directory. It is not created yet because there are no figures to populate.

## Subsections/Subfiles
- Write everything (without preambles) in `Subfiles/` directory.

## Document template
- Can be found in `LTJournalArticle.cls` in case you are curious.
