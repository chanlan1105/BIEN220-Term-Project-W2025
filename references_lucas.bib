  abstract = {The goal of this review is to introduce the biomaterials community to the emerging field of self-healing materials, and also to suggest how one could utilize and modify self-healing approaches to develop new classes of biomaterials. A brief discussion of the in vivo mechanical loading and resultant failures experienced by biomedical implants is followed by presentation of the self-healing methods for combating mechanical failure. If conventional composite materials that retard failure may be considered zeroth generation self-healing materials, then taxonomically-speaking, first generation self-healing materials describe approaches that “halt” and “fill” damage, whereas second generation self-healing materials strive to “fully restore” the pre-failed material structure. In spite of limited commercial use to date, primarily because the technical details have not been suitably optimized, it is likely from a practical standpoint that first generation approaches will be the first to be employed commercially, whereas second generation approaches may take longer to implement. For self-healing biomaterials the optimization of technical considerations is further compounded by the additional constraints of toxicity and biocompatibility, necessitating inclusion of separate discussions of design criteria for self-healing biomaterials.},

  abstract = {Polymeric hydrogels are widely explored materials for biomedical applications. However, they have inherent limitations like poor resistance to stimuli and low mechanical strength. This drawback of hydrogels gave rise to ‘‘smart self-healing hydrogels’’ which autonomously repair themselves when ruptured or traumatized. It is superior in terms of durability and stability due to its capacity to reform its shape, injectability, and stretchability thereby regaining back the original mechanical property. This review focuses on various self-healing mechanisms (covalent and non-covalent interactions) of these hydrogels, methods used to evaluate their self-healing properties, and their applications in wound healing, drug delivery, cell encapsulation, and tissue engineering systems. Furthermore, composite materials are used to enhance the hydrogel’s mechanical properties. Hence, findings of research with various composite materials are briefly discussed in order to emphasize the healing capacity of such hydrogels. Additionally, various methods to evaluate the self-healing properties of hydrogels and their recent advancements towards 3D bioprinting are also reviewed. The review is concluded by proposing several pertinent challenges encountered at present as well as some prominent future perspectives.},

  abstract = {Hydrogels that provide mechanical support and sustainedly release therapeutics have been used to treat tendon injuries. However, most hydrogels are insufficiently tough, release drugs in bursts, and require cell infiltration or suturing to integrate with surrounding tissue. Here, we report that a hydrogel serving as a high-capacity drug depot and combining a dissipative tough matrix on one side and a chitosan adhesive surface on the other side supports tendon gliding and strong adhesion (larger than 1,000 J/m2) to tendon on opposite surfaces of the hydrogel, as we show with porcine and human tendon preparations during cyclic-friction loadings. The hydrogel is biocompatible, strongly adheres to patellar, supraspinatus and Achilles tendons of live rats, boosted healing and reduced scar formation in a rat model of Achilles-tendon rupture, and sustainedly released the corticosteroid triamcinolone acetonide in a rat model of patellar tendon injury, reducing inflammation, modulating chemokine secretion, recruiting tendon stem and progenitor cells, and promoting macrophage polarization to the M2 phenotype. Hydrogels with ‘Janus’ surfaces and sustained-drug-release functionality could be designed for a range of biomedical applications.},

Healthy tendons and ligaments contain high levels of collagen with a structured orientation, which gives rise to their characteristic normal imaging appearances as well as causing particular imaging artefacts. Changes to ligaments and tendons as a result of disease and injury can be demonstrated using both ultrasound and MRI. These have been validated against surgical and histological findings.

  abstract = {Hydrogels are crosslinked polymer chains with three-dimensional (3D) network structures, which can absorb relatively large amounts of fluid. Because of the high water content, soft structure, and porosity of hydrogels, they closely resemble living tissues. Research in recent years shows that hydrogels have been applied in various fields, such as agriculture, biomaterials, the food industry, drug delivery, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine. Along with the underlying technology improvements of hydrogel development, hydrogels can be expected to be applied in more fields. Although not all hydrogels have good biodegradability and biocompatibility, such as synthetic hydrogels (polyvinyl alcohol, polyacrylamide, polyethylene glycol hydrogels, etc.), their biodegradability and biocompatibility can be adjusted by modification of their functional group or incorporation of natural polymers. Hence, scientists are still interested in the biomedical applications of hydrogels due to their creative adjustability for different uses. In this review, we first introduce the basic information of hydrogels, such as structure, classification, and synthesis. Then, we further describe the recent applications of hydrogels in 3D cell cultures, drug delivery, wound dressing, and tissue engineering.},

  abstract = {An ideal wound dressing is highly desired for the repair of chronic wounds which should provide a moist environment, self-healing, antibacterial properties etc. Here, a novel injectable antibacterial chitosan hydrogel with good self-healing and improved mechanical properties has been prepared by dialdehyde bacterial cellulose (DABC) nanofibers as the non-toxic biocrosslinker. It is the first time to prepare the all-natural chitosan hydrogels by using ascorbic acid (VC) as solvent to dissolve chitosan and the natural fiber DABC as reinforcing and crosslinking agent. Then, the disadvantage of the use of acetic acid in the medical field was overcome and the other toxic crosslinking agents were abandoned. Accordingly, this work provides a new strategy towards fabricating the self-healing hydrogel with injectable and antibacterial properties. The new multifunctional hydrogels demonstrate strong potentiality in wound dressings or tissue engineering.},

  abstract = {Severe bone defects can be caused by various factors, such as tumor resection, severe trauma, and infection. However, bone regeneration capacity is limited up to a critical-size defect, and further intervention is required. Currently, the most common clinical method to repair bone defects is bone grafting, where autografts are the “gold standard.” However, the disadvantages of autografts, including inflammation, secondary trauma and chronic disease, limit their application. Bone tissue engineering (BTE) is an attractive strategy for repairing bone defects and has been widely researched. In particular, hydrogels with a three-dimensional network can be used as scaffolds for BTE owing to their hydrophilicity, biocompatibility, and large porosity. Self-healing hydrogels respond rapidly, autonomously, and repeatedly to induced damage and can maintain their original properties (i.e., mechanical properties, fluidity, and biocompatibility) following self-healing. This review focuses on self-healing hydrogels and their applications in bone defect repair. Moreover, we discussed the recent progress in this research field. Despite the significant existing research achievements, there are still challenges that need to be addressed to promote clinical research of self-healing hydrogels in bone defect repair and increase the market penetration., Self-healing hydrogels respond rapidly, autonomously, and repeatedly to induced damage and can maintain their original properties.
