	abstract = {Adhesion to wet and dynamic surfaces, including biological tissues, is important in many fields, but has proven extremely challenging. Existing adhesives are either cytotoxic, adhere weakly to tissues, or cannot be utilized in wet environments. We report a bio-inspired design for adhesives consisting of two layers: an adhesive surface and a dissipative matrix. The former adheres to the substrate by electrostatic interactions, covalent bonds, and physical interpenetration. The latter amplifies energy dissipation through hysteresis. The two layers synergistically lead to higher adhesion energy on wet surfaces than existing adhesives. Adhesion occurs within minutes, independent of blood exposure, and compatible with in vivo dynamic movements. This family of adhesives may be useful in many areas of application, including tissue adhesives, wound dressings and tissue repair.},

	abstract = {When the crosslinking reactions of Chapter 6 are driven far beyond the gel point, nearly all species are attached to the gel in a single macroscopic network polymer. Such networks, with either chemical or strong physical bonds, are important soft solids. If the glass transition and melting temperatures are below room temperature, the material is a rubber. Rubbers are an important class of materials with many practical uses. Common examples are rubber bands, gaskets, adhesives, and automobile tires. Rubber bands can be stretched enormous amounts without breaking or even losing their elasticity. In this chapter, the physics that allow for such marvellous properties will be considered in detail. The entropic nature of elasticity in rubbers is the origin of their remarkable mechanical properties.},

	abstract = {As swollen polymer networks in water, hydrogels are usually brittle. However, hydrogels with high toughness play critical roles in many plant and animal tissues as well as in diverse engineering applications. Here we review the intrinsic mechanisms of a wide variety of tough hydrogels developed over the past few decades. We show that tough hydrogels generally possess mechanisms to dissipate substantial mechanical energy but still maintain high elasticity under deformation. The integrations and interactions of different mechanisms for dissipating energy and maintaining elasticity are essential to the design of tough hydrogels. A matrix that combines various mechanisms is constructed for the first time to guide the design of next-generation tough hydrogels. We further highlight that a particularly promising strategy for the design is to implement multiple mechanisms across multiple length scales into nano-, micro-, meso-, and macro-structures of hydrogels.},
